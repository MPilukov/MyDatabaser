# Overview
win-form application for quick execution simple select from ms-sql

# Description
Sometimes I want to execute a small query to the database,
but I don't want to wait a minute to run SSMS or a faster dbforge (but still not instant).
So I've sketched out a simple form that just executes queries.
It will be necessary to add functions (getting a list of tables, procedures, etc.)

## Requirements
